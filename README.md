Yeah, we should all be doing a lot more of that and a lot less netflix, tinder, tumblr, hulu or twitter. No offense to the above platforms, you're all lovely and sharply dressed. But let's learn a little.

### Install It: 
`chmod +x disco && cp disco /usr/local/bin/`

### Then you disco. 
It goes a little something like this: 

```
$ disco

Look what I found! List of moths of Russia (Gelechioidea)!! Sounds Fascinating
Should we keep looking?[y/N]
y

Look what I found! Tekamah, Nebraska!! Sounds Fascinating
Should we keep looking?[y/N]
```

Press "N" and the selected article will open in your browser. From there, things will only get curiouser and curiouser.
